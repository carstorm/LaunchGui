##FAQ:

* __Oh no! I found a bug/leak with it! D:__
   
   Please feel free to make a PR with a fix or open an issue on GitHub.

* __Can you include X feature?__
   
   Maybe, I'm not that good coding and this is meant to be more of a  personal mod that other people may find useful however feel to suggest (or add via a  pull request) and I may add it. If you want the feature anyways feel free to fork the project!

* __Why should I use this?__
   
  Sometimes you need (or want) to let your players know something on launch.

* __Can you port to Minecraft 1.X.X?__ 
   
   Since this is meant mostly as a  personal project I will NOT backport. I have plans to keep it updated with MC as my modpack updates.

* __Why did you make this?__

   I forked it because I needed additional features that was beyond the scope of the oridinal mod!
